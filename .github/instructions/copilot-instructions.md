# Blender Add-on Development for Blender 5.x.x and Later

When generating code for a Blender add-on, ensure the following:
- The `__init__.py` file is properly structured to define the add-on's metadata and registration functions.
- Include necessary imports for Blender's API, such as `bpy`.
- Provide a clear and concise description of the add-on's purpose and functionality.
- Ensure the add-on is compatible with Blender 5.x.x and later versions.
- Include error handling and logging where appropriate.
- Follow Blender's coding standards and best practices for Blender 5.x.x and later.
- Use any new features or APIs introduced in Blender 5.x.x where applicable, and ensure the code is forward-compatible.
- Avoid hardcoding version numbers where possible to ensure compatibility with future releases.
